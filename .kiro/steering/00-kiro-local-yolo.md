# Kiro Local YOLO Development

## Core Philosophy

This is LOCAL development with NO CI/CD gates, NO branch protection, NO GitHub tokens. You work directly on the codebase, test locally, and commit when ready.

## Development Flow

1. **Read the task** from `.kiro/specs/{feature}/tasks.md`
2. **Implement the code** - write all necessary files
3. **Test locally** - run tests with `pnpm test` or `pytest`
4. **Update memory bank** - document what was completed
5. **Commit** - use conventional commits
6. **Move to next task immediately** - Don't stop for review

## Key Rules

### DO:
- ✅ Work on ONE task at a time
- ✅ Test locally before committing
- ✅ Use `pnpm` for TypeScript packages
- ✅ Use `uv` for Python packages
- ✅ Read requirements and design docs to understand context
- ✅ Update memory bank with progress
- ✅ Commit with conventional commit messages
- ✅ Move to next task immediately without stopping for review

### DON'T:
- ❌ Try to use GitHub MCP or create PRs (no tokens configured)
- ❌ Worry about CI/CD (not set up yet)
- ❌ Try to push to remote (local development only)
- ❌ Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- ❌ Skip testing before moving to next task

## Testing Commands

### TypeScript (Otterfall)
```bash
cd packages/otterfall
pnpm test --run              # Unit tests
pnpm run lint                # Linting
pnpm run build               # Build check
```

### Python
```bash
cd packages/{package-name}
pytest                       # Unit tests
ruff check .                 # Linting
mypy .                       # Type checking
```

## Task Execution

When implementing a task:

1. **Mark task as in_progress** using taskStatus tool
2. **Read all relevant files** (requirements, design, existing code)
3. **Implement the feature** completely
4. **Test the implementation** locally
5. **Mark task as completed** using taskStatus tool
6. **Update memory bank** with what was completed
7. **Commit** with conventional commit message
8. **Move to next subtask/task immediately** - no stopping for review

## Autonomous Task Execution

**CRITICAL: Work through ALL subtasks autonomously**

When given a parent task with subtasks:
- ✅ Complete ALL subtasks in sequence
- ✅ Move from one subtask to the next automatically
- ✅ Only stop when ALL subtasks are complete
- ❌ DO NOT stop after each subtask to ask for permission
- ❌ DO NOT wait for user approval between subtasks

Example: If task 2.1 has subtasks 2.1.1 through 2.1.5:
1. Complete 2.1.1 → commit → move to 2.1.2
2. Complete 2.1.2 → commit → move to 2.1.3
3. Continue until 2.1.5 is done
4. Mark parent task 2.1 as complete
5. Report completion of entire task group

**The user wants you to work autonomously. Trust yourself and keep going.**

## Memory Bank

Update `memory-bank/{feature}-progress.md` with:
- What was completed
- What files were modified
- Any issues encountered
- Next steps

## No External Dependencies

- No GitHub tokens
- No CI/CD pipelines
- No remote pushes
- No PR creation
- Just local code, local tests, local commits

## Focus on Implementation

Your job is to:
1. Implement features according to specs
2. Write tests that validate correctness
3. Ensure code works locally
4. Document progress

That's it. Keep it simple.
